## Some heading  
Just trying out and see how it looks on my local server  
Text is **bold**  
Text is *italics*  
Text is ***bold italics***  
text is ~~crossed off~~  
text is <mark>highlighted</mark>

Trying some code block  
```
print(hello world)  
def func(x, y):
    y = x**2
    return y
print(func(1, 2))
```


This is some random link:  
[Google](https://google.com)

Trying some LaTex features:  
\$$ y_{n+1} = y_n + hF(x_n, y_n) \$$

Trying some inline math \$ x + y = z \$, worked

Note: Have to put backslashes before the dollar sign otherwise jekyll would escape them and the math mode wouldn't work
